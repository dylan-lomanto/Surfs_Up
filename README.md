# Surfs_Up

### Overview
The purpoose of this analysis is to examine temperature and precipitation data from Oahu to determine if the island possesses a viable climate for a year-round sufr and ice cream shop.  This analysis will be examining results from June and December to get a complete view of the weather throughout the year. 

### Results

1. The average temperature varies only 3.9 degrees between December (71.04F) and June (74.94F). This is a good indicator that the temperature remains warm but moderate for the entire year. 

2. The maximum temperature in December is reported as 83F while the maximum for June is reported as 85F. These highs are not extreme temperatures and will not limit customers due to excessive heat.

3. The minimum recorded temperature for December is 56F while is is 64F in June. The minimum temperature in June is well within the acceptable surfing range, but it may be too low in December. This tells us that the minimum temperature is not likely to deter customers for at least half of the year.

### Summary

The temperature data indicates that Oahu has a mild but warm climate year round. The maximum temperatures should never deter customers, nor should the average temperatures. The minimum temperature in December may be low enough to deter surfers, but that is not the case during June. It is possible that business will slow down in the winter due to the lowered minimum temperature, but it will not cease entirely.  Overall the temperature data suggests that Oahu is a good location for a surf/ice cream shop. 

In addition to the temperature queries I have run queries to determine the summary statistics for precipitation in December and June.
